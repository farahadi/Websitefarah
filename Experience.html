         I will tell a story about my experience during high school and also at university. 
         The experiences about my high school was during 2017 which I was 17. My class is 
         only class that do not have boys which 41 girls in total. That was amazing because
         there is no secret that you can keep between your classmate. We create a lot of 
         memories such as we handling a few events for example, Hari Keusahawanan on 2017, 
         which we cooked our own food and sell it to all students. That was a great experience. 
         My deskmates on 2017, were Ainur, Alyaa, Haziqah and Syazwani. There's a lot ups and 
         downs together and we managed to stay until now. The other event or program that we did
         was we sold a sandwiches to students who has ordered which for me is a great experience
         because we were working together to achieve our target. The experience that I will never 
         forget during high school was our Graduation Day. All my friends were beautiful on that 
         time. We happy that most of my classmates achieve their target to joined the graduation. 
         I will never forget about that forever. I miss my high school friends so much and I hope 
         that they are in a good health.

         For university life, I entered on July 2018. The second person I met after my ex classmates which
         is Aida, was Farah. I cannot believe that we are so close and we are classmates. There a lot of 
         things happened for 2 years I am in UiTM Kedah. This is the people that I will go to the event 
         together. We always planned to go to the events and each of us will remind that the event is 
         coming soon and so on. They always help me in when I have problem, when I am stress with assignments,
         and with them that I hang out together. We always have each other and make sure that we are okay. 
         I thank enough for knowing and close with them. There only 2 years but I just want to be in my life 
         forever. The experience that we go through for the first time was Colour Run, 2018. That was amazing 
         because we completed to go the events.

         Sekretariat Rukun Negara (SRN). My another family in UiTM Kedah. I cannot describe how much I 
         appreciate them in my life. I first joined their program was September 2018. I became part of
         their family on 2019. There's a lot of experiences that I got from them. Big thanks for Sir Azam, 
         Alia Norman & Norman Hanef. They teached me a lot such as teamwork, how to handling an event, I also
         know a lot of people. They are very kind to me which if I do not understand about something, they willing
         to teach me. The best experience with SRN Family was Hari Kebangsaan on September 2019. That was my first 
         time handling a big event. The students who came were almost 2 thousands. From there, I got a lot of experiences
         and it will give me a best memories to keep. We always meet each other not even only for meeting, but chit chat 
         together. I love them so much, they giving me a lot of experiences that I can use for the future. There are no
         words to describe how much I love  them. I wish them a happy life with their loved ones.
